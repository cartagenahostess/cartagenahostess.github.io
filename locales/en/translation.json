    "lisneyDesc": "Meet your hostess. I was born and raised in Cartagena, Colombia. Since I was little, I've been joyful and I've had the desire to help others. I think that desire was born when I saw my mother, who had to be both a father and mother, come home very tired after a long day at work. So, little by little I began to feel inclined towards healthcare, which would allow me to help many. A few years later, I moved to the United States where I received higher education and graduated as a nurse. I was finally able to do what I liked the most. However, the reason why I decided to start Cartagena Hostess is because I had to undergo a procedure in which I was left with a scar, and the cost to correct it was very high in the USA, and also, I did not know anyone who could advise me. Now that I am in Colombia, a country that offers beautiful places to rest and that at the same time is the home of many esthetic professionals who offer the best quality treatments, I feel motivated to help those who want to get out of the routine or undergo some cosmetic change. Welcome!",
